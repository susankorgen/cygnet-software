          8 days, after 4 years full time using a different, proprietary server side language full time
          for database development.
          Prior to these 4 years, I wrote and generated JavaScript as a UI developer full time from 2009-2016.
        </p><p>
          The 8 days started with 2 days of <em>Javascript: The Good Parts</em> by Douglas Crockford.
          Page 34 mentions the hanoi problem and provides a loop.
          Recursion can be challenging to visualize.
        </p><p>
          Page 34 inspired me to build a hanoi animation as a JavaScript code example,
          while packing in as many UI/UX best practices from my past UI development experience
          as I could fit at this small scale.
        </p><p>
          Comments at the end of <strong>main.js</strong> list the specific
          planned updates to complete the example. These comments list
          standard UI/UX best practices I think this code could
          demonstrate, given time to add them.
