          Why was this code so much quicker to complete than <strong>hanoi</strong>?
          It leverages language-agnostic skills I use daily.

          Since 2016, in back end development, I have worked with
          structured data formats, transforming and storing
          data in a proprietary
          database that offers both object-oriented and SQL projections.

          When you spend all your time traversing hierarchical data
          structures and finding optimal
          paths to the data needed, the thinking is similar, regardless of
          language or output format: JSON, XML, classes, SQL result sets,
          FHIR, C-CDA, or other.

        <li>Design and build all projects myself. They must be fun and express my interests. </li>
        <li>Be guided by my professional experience and capacity to learn, plus the market.</li>
        <li>Learn: Start with all IDEs, languages, tools, and libraries I do <em>not</em> know. </li>
        <li>Apply best practices I know that transcend specific "tech stacks". Show how they transfer.</li>
        <li>Be transparent: Commit updates frequently, adding incremental slices of value, with notes.</li>
        <li>Create simplicity, utility, and beauty with code: In a cave! With a box of scraps! Then show how. </li>
