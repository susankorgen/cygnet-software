# 2024 Retrospective

Looking back on 3 years at Project Ronin
as a Staff Integrations Engineer and acting Principal Data Engineer in Data Science,
I can proudly say I became fluent in both Python and Kotlin languages while
contributing back-end code on data integration and data engineering teams.

Great to see solid progress since this 2020 starting point as a Principal Software Engineer
at InterSystems specializing in InterSystems ObjectScript for back-end, and JavaScript for full-stack.

# 2020 Learning Portfolio

My 12+ years of software development experience is at every level
of the stack, from system internals to product design.
I focus on back-end data, with a strong past in UI and design.

My professional code runs all over the world.
It solves critically important problems and
opens urgently timed market opportunities in health care.
It is valuable and robust.
And, it is written in a proprietary language that few can read.

For professional growth,
I seek more channels of collaboration.
A starting point is to learn new languages that others know.

* I am building **Python** to a teaching level from scratch, to reflect my data interests.
* I refreshed **JavaScript** after 5 years away from full-time UI coding.

Below are links to code and demos.
I hope you enjoy these snapshots from my journey.
